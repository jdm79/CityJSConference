This workshop will explain why and when you might want to use TypeScript, and get you up and running with all the essentials. In this workshop we will cover practically the full language. And we will go deep. That is: do the cool and weird meta programming stuff. Learn all the tricks you won't find in the handbook.<br \/><br \/>This workshop is also suitable for those that have basic experience with TypeScript. Since the basics only take ~2 hours to cover, most of the day is still super valuable to enhance your TypeScript skills, even if you already have real project experience with TypeScript! Did you ever encounter super confusing types in some of the libraries you use? Did you get some super vague compiler errors? After this workshop you will be able to understand them!<\/p>",
