        "talk": "<p>I've been developing in JavaScript for nearly 20 years and so am used to solving every problem with a JavaScript-shaped hammer. I don't think I'm alone in this, and wanted to break out of that mindset. Over my career I've professional developed in 16 different languages (and used a further 10 out of curiosity) so I set about re-writing the same code in each of those languages. The purpose of the exercise was (and is) to learn, re-learn, and refresh my memory of these programming languages.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By focusing on the paradigms, syntax, data types, and structure of the code I was able to draw parallels between them and JavaScript which encourages me to think outside of the JavaScript-shaped box. This talk will take you on that journey of discovery highlighting many ideas you can take back into your own code, and well as giving an insight into many other languages you might not have seen. It will also make you thankful, or otherwise, by showing what you need to work through in other languages to achieve the same results as JavaScript.<\/p>",

There were no standards, so developers had to make different versions of every website they built so that they&rsquo;re compatible with the browsers at the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The web saw both a rise in creativity, and in really serious security vulnerabilities, as it became exponentially harder to develop for it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the adoption of (much needed) web standards and the dotCom crash, the focus has shifted to stabilising and unifying the way we build, consume, and think about the web, and naturally some of the technologies died along the way being unable to keep up. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The web as most of us know it today became variations of the same ideas and ways of building, with one language to rule the ecosystem : JavaScript. Some also argue that the web became &lsquo;serious,&rsquo; corporate, and a way to make money, to the detriment of creativity and innovation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the idea of running other languages on the web was still in people&rsquo;s hearts, so a new glimmer of hope was born, and named WebAssembly or WASM. Simply put, WASM provides other languages like C++ and Rust a compilation target so that they can run on the web. All designed to nicely play alongside JavaScript. How exciting is that!?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this talk, we will explore WASM as a way of bringing things that are not of the web, to the web. We will discuss how WebAssembly can open the web to even more engineers and creators, and boost<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creativity and innovation in a secure and performant way.<\/span><\/p>",

If you have ever wanted to test your front-end app, if you ever tried to test it, if you have ever hated a bunch of UI tests and removed them from your pipelines... Well, this talk is for you \ud83d\ude4c I am going to show the challenges coming from automating user flows, checking everything worthwhile for the end-user, creating an ally that prevents you to add regressions, and why Cypress is an amazing tool for these purposes. Cypress enforces you to respect a lot of testing best practices, guarantees a good developer experience, and allow you to forget a lot of bad testing habits. And if you feel you are not ready for writing tests yet... I am going to show you what are the Cypress' features that could improve your everyday productivity, something you always care about \ud83d\ude0a.<\/p>",

While we do draw from existing analytics data and user research to determine how and what to prefetch, this process is still largely manual. Making an accurate prediction that noticeably saves one render time becomes progressively more difficult as your site scales since there&rsquo;s no sure way of knowing where a user will go next. This is where machine learning comes in handy. Advances in machine learning have given us the capacity to train models that will more accurately predict user flows and determine the resources a user will need on next page render.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The convergence of machine learning and web performance is still in its infancy. However, with the growing popularity of machine learning (especially among web developers), it&rsquo;s only a matter of time when techniques like predictive prefetching will become more commonplace on the web.<\/p>",
