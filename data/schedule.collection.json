This workshop will explain why and when you might want to use TypeScript, and get you up and running with all the essentials. In this workshop we will cover practically the full language. And we will go deep. That is: do the cool and weird meta programming stuff. Learn all the tricks you won't find in the handbook.<br \/><br \/>This workshop is also suitable for those that have basic experience with TypeScript. Since the basics only take ~2 hours to cover, most of the day is still super valuable to enhance your TypeScript skills, even if you already have real project experience with TypeScript! Did you ever encounter super confusing types in some of the libraries you use? Did you get some super vague compiler errors? After this workshop you will be able to understand them!<\/p>\n<p>Date: 15\/9\/2020 09:00 - 17:00<br data-v-83a16682=\"\" \/><br data-v-83a16682=\"\" \/><strong data-v-83a16682=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cityjsconf.org\/buytickets\" data-v-83a16682=\"\">Buy Tickets &gt;&gt;<\/a><\/strong><\/p>",

We&rsquo;ll also look at key advances in TypeScript that took the project from promising yet flawed to something that made it possible to rewrite the longest-lived, actively-maintained JavaScript framework in TypeScript and become a development approach that we love and appreciate.

        "description": "<p>GraphQL is a query language that combines type validation with a query and filtering syntax that makes it easy to get up-and-running with a powerful web API in almost no time. Add to that a vibrant community that keeps creating excellent tooling and documentation, it&rsquo;s clear why GraphQL has become so popular with developers.<br \/><br \/>Every abstraction has a cost, and GraphQL is no exception. The added complexity and a new schema format to parse and execute mean new performance bottlenecks. In addition to performance issues, the wrong use of GraphQL can lead to architectural bottlenecks.<br \/><br \/>Instead of viewing this as a problem, we took this as a challenge, and in this talk, we will unveil how we made it run a lot faster on Node.js using different performance techniques that we have learned in the last few years.<\/p>",
